# PocketGravity
Creating Reality Hackathon 2018
## Inspiration

Many testers have told me that they have problems understanding/moving around 3D objects in the the virtual mobile AR space. This is most likely due to lack of a depth camera but I would like to challenge that we can turn such a problem on its head through technical design decisions.

## What it does

The AR mobile app will have an assortment of fun, interactive, 3D spatial puzzles that float in the AR virtual world and thus force you to move your body left and right, up and down, to figure out how to solve the puzzle. Through your actions, process, and repeated tries, you will find yourself gaining a better grasp at how to move and use 3D objects in the mobile AR environment. 

## How I built it

Through the Unity Game Engine with Apple ARkit SDK.
